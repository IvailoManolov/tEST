In this game you can move a rocketship UP and DOWN and try to avoid all the
asteroids and collect all diamonds flying towards you. You can also use the rocketship's 
cannon to shoot projectiles by pressing SPACE and destroy incoming asteroids, 
but be careful, you can also destroy diamonds this way! Be cautious with asteroids
that are larger in size. Once a larger asteroid is destroyed, smaller asteroids from 
the explosion will be flying in direction of your rocketship. The smaller the asteroid, 
the faster it travels!

When it comes to difficulty, as time passes, more and more asteroids will be on the
way to your rocketship.

You have only 3 lives, so take risks only when necessary. Hitting a larger asteroid
means instant death!

There are some cool planets in the background.
